# Option A: To Do List

### Overview:

A to do list can be defined as a list of tasks, detailing what needs to be accomplished. **Program!**

**Individual project**

### What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

* **Variables**: Understanding types, and working with variables and constants
* **Conditionals**: Using if/else statements and the ternary operator
* **Numbers**: Swift's number types and related operators
* **Switches**: Switch statements, ranges, bindings, and where clauses
* **Loops**: For, while, and repeat-while loops
* **Strings**: Working with strings, understanding Unicode and its implications
* **Optionals**: Optional types, unwrapping, and nil coalescence
* **Arrays**: Arrays, mutability and immutability, navigating the documentation
* **Dictionaries**: Dictionaries, looping over the contents of a dictionary, mutability and immutability
* **Sets**: Sets, set operations including unions, intersections, and subtraction
* **Functions**: Function syntax, parameters, return types, guard statements, function types
* **Closures**: Closures and their syntax, sorting, scope capture, functional programming patterns
* **Enumerations**: Enumerations, raw values, associated values, adding methods and properties to enumerations
* **Structs and Classes**:  Struct and class syntax, methods, inheritance
* **Properties**: Stored properties, computed properties, lazy properties, property observers, access control
* **Initialization**: Struct initialization, class initialization, failable initializers
* **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
* **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
* **Products and Teams**: Document your code and your code repository so others understand what you've built.

### Big Goals

* **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your program** to the world

### Technical Requirements

Your To Do List program must:

* Stick with **KISS \(Keep It Simple Stupid\)** and **DRY \(Don't Repeat Yourself\)** principles
* Have well-formatted, and well-commented code

#### User Stories

* As a user, I should be able to create a new list
* As a user, I should be able to create a new to do item
* As a user, I should be able to read all to do items
* As a user, I should be able to update one to do item (mark it complete, change item text, update completion date)
* As a user, I should be able to delete item from to do list

**Potential Extra TO DO LIST Features**

* Ability to have multiple To Do Lists
* Sort List Items by completed status

**Super Potential Extra TO DO LIST Features**

* Sort Lists by date
* Filter Items by date or completed status

### README Suggestions

* Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
* List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
* Describe how some of your favorite functions work

### Necessary Deliverables

* Projects are due Thursday, 14/10/2021 at 9 am!
* A **working program, built by you**
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your repo, and frequent commits dating back to the _very beginning of the project_.
* A `README.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, any other useful information.
* A **5 minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:
  * What is the project about?
  * Is there any information you think might help us understand what you built?
  * What features did you include?
    * Make sure to explain anything "new" \(things that we didn't cover in class\)
  * What was the most difficult part of the project?
  * What was your favorite part to work on?
  * What would you like to add next?
  * Demo of the program

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** \(data, presentation\) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Developer Tools** \(`print`\) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class, **ask questions and come to office hours** when you need to. Think about adding relevant code to your project each day, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Check out Tutorial and Documentation resources** at home to better understand what you'll be getting into.
* **Don't be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.**
* **Begin working on the user stories, ONE at a time**
